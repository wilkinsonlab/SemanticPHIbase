SemanticPHI execution instructions

The project has been developed using Java as language programming under Eclipse IDE. It can be loaded as a project
from Eclipse.

To run the program it is necessary to execute the Main class which is in the package es.upm.cbgp.semphi.logic

The execution of this class will show a menu with 3 options:

1. Create a dump file from version 3.8 of the XML file
2. Create a dump file from version 4 of the XML file
3. Exit

Both options 1 and 2 will create a dump RDF file which will be stored under "ont" folder with
the name "PHI_populated.owl".

If you look into the source code, an interesting parameter in the execution of the ontology populator (OntologyPopulator class)
is the second parameter which is received by the constructor:

OntologyPopulator op = new OntologyPopulator(pxe, true);

This second parameter, which by default is set as true is the option to annotate the resulting RDF file with SKOS.

We recommend to swith this option off (change the parameter to false) if you want a quick and light dump generation.

The activation of the SKOS parameter implies that the resulting file will be larger and it will take more time to
execute the process.
